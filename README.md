You can work with this notebook in this repositopry in Jupyter Notebook, which is included in the Anaconda distribution of Python. You can find some installation guidelines for Anaconda on the following address: https://cdsleiden.github.io/python-tutorial/Installation.html
 

If Anaconda has been installed correctly on your computer, you can follow the steps below. 

-	Download the files for the workshop via the URL below:
https://github.com/peterverhaar/reading_poetry_notebooks/archive/refs/heads/main.zip 
-	This will download a zipped folder. The file may be saved automatically in your ‘Downloads’ folder. Move the zipped folder to a location that you can access easily, such as ‘Documents’. 
-	Once you have moved the file, unzip the folder. 
-	Open Jupyter Notebook using “Anaconda Navigator” > “Launch Jupyter Notebook”
-	In the Jupyter Notebook that you have downloaded, navigate to the folder that you have downloaded and unzipped, and open the file named ‘Workshop Computational Analysis of Poetry.ipynb’. 
-	To test if everything works correctly, you can click on “Cell” > “Run all”.

If the steps that have been explained above do not work, for whatever reason, you can work with the notebook online, via an application named “Binder”. 

Once the page has opened, click on “Run” > “Run all cells”.
